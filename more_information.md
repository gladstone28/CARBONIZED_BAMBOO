MORE INFORMATION ON CARBONIZED BAMBOO
========================================

Carbonized bamboo is made by heating bamboo at a high temperature in a carbonizer which results in a dark amber color that may be variegated or fairly uniform⁵. The carbonization process can be divided into four stages according to temperature and condition in a kiln¹. Here are some steps that can be followed to make carbonized bamboo:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cut the bamboo into small pieces and dry them.
2. Put the dried bamboo pieces into a kiln and heat them up to 120°C for about 4 hours.
3. Increase the temperature of the kiln to 220°C and keep it at this temperature for about 2 hours.
4. Increase the temperature of the kiln again to 300°C and keep it at this temperature for about 2 hours.
5. Increase the temperature of the kiln again to 500°C and keep it at this temperature for about 2 hours.
6. Finally, increase the temperature of the kiln again to 800°C and keep it at this temperature for about 4 hours.

The organic materials and sugars are burnt during the process, which is the primary reason for color change⁴.

2. Long service life: Bamboo itself is a very long-lived plant, and carbonized bamboo can last even longer¹.
3. Easy maintenance: Carbonized bamboo flooring is easy to clean and maintain¹.
4. Aesthetically pleasing: Carbonized bamboo has a rich and sophisticated color that can accommodate a wide array of styles².
