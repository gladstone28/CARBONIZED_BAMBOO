INFORMATION ON CARBONIZED BAMBOO 
================================


What is Carbonized Bamboo?
--------------------------

Carbonized bamboo is a type of bamboo that has been processed through a heating method that changes its color, texture, and physical properties. The process involves heating the bamboo to a high temperature of 200°C (392°F) to 300°C (572°F) in a controlled environment without the presence of oxygen.

This heating process causes the bamboo's natural sugars to break down and change the bamboo's color from its natural light yellow to a darker brown or caramel color. The heating process also makes the bamboo more resistant to moisture, pests, and decay.

Carbonized bamboo is commonly used in flooring, furniture, and other home decor products because of its unique color and durability. It is also considered an eco-friendly option because bamboo is a renewable resource that grows quickly and can be harvested without causing damage to the environment.


The following is a list of 10 steps in the process of making carbonized bamboo:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Harvest mature bamboo stalks and cut them into smaller sections.
2. Remove the outer layer of the bamboo using a sharp knife or scraper.
3. Cut the bamboo into smaller strips or planks of uniform size.
4. Place the bamboo in a sealed kiln or oven with no oxygen.
5. Heat the bamboo to a temperature of 200°C (392°F) to 300°C (572°F) for several hours.
6. Monitor the temperature and adjust it as needed to ensure even heating.
7. Allow the bamboo to cool gradually over several hours or even days.
8. Sand or plane the bamboo to smooth out any rough spots or uneven areas.
9. Apply a protective finish to the bamboo to enhance its durability and appearance.
10. Package the finished carbonized bamboo products for shipping or use in construction and design projects.

========================================

Carbonized bamboo is made by heating bamboo at a high temperature in a carbonizer which results in a dark amber color that may be variegated or fairly uniform⁵. The carbonization process can be divided into four stages according to temperature and condition in a kiln¹. Here are some steps that can be followed to make carbonized bamboo:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Cut the bamboo into small pieces and dry them.
2. Put the dried bamboo pieces into a kiln and heat them up to 120°C for about 4 hours.
3. Increase the temperature of the kiln to 220°C and keep it at this temperature for about 2 hours.
4. Increase the temperature of the kiln again to 300°C and keep it at this temperature for about 2 hours.
5. Increase the temperature of the kiln again to 500°C and keep it at this temperature for about 2 hours.
6. Finally, increase the temperature of the kiln again to 800°C and keep it at this temperature for about 4 hours.

The organic materials and sugars are burnt during the process, which is the primary reason for color change⁴.

Carbonized bamboo has several benefits that make it a popular choice for flooring and other applications. Here are some of them:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Durability: Carbonized bamboo flooring is more durable and corrosion-resistant than ordinary flooring because a complex chemical reaction takes place inside it after carbonization which effectively curbs the growth of fungi in the floor¹.
2. Long service life: Bamboo itself is a very long-lived plant, and carbonized bamboo can last even longer¹.
3. Easy maintenance: Carbonized bamboo flooring is easy to clean and maintain¹.
4. Aesthetically pleasing: Carbonized bamboo has a rich and sophisticated color that can accommodate a wide array of styles².
5. Health benefits: Bamboo has many health benefits such as being used as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, healing depression, improving mental alertness, helping in spiritual healing, etc³. Health benefits of carbonized bamboo are among the major reasons for its popularity³.
